# Backup org-CSS Files


So Typically we want the org-css files to be backup, using `stow` and `git`,
and linked back, that way there is only one file and no mind
has to be paid to synchronisation, however, everytime I move the
directory around, the symlinks will break, I expect the org-css
files to break all the time, so I'm just making a backup here.
