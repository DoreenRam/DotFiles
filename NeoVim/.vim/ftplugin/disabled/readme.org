* Why it was Disabled
Using Vim-Latex Suite in conjuction wit VimTeX isn't so bad, but, it
conflicts with the C-J binding for UltiSnips, which means I can't use
YouComplete me or a uniform binding across emacs and vim (because of company
mode)
* How to re-enable
Just move it up one directory out of this hidden directory, this would do it:

#+begin_src bash
mv tex_latexSuite.vim ../
mv latex-suite/ ../
#+end_src
